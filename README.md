# bin_oct_hex_conversion_practice
Simple python program to help students practice binary, octal, and hexadecimal conversions.

I wrote this program a couple of years ago when I was teaching students digital logic. I figured I would post it here so that 
anyone could use it as a practice tool. Enjoy.

Requirements:
Only requirement for this program to work is that python is installed.
